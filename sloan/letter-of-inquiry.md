## **Nature of the Proposed Project**

Our proposal falls under the Better Software for Science categories. Within this
category, our proposal fits two of the three available focus areas; Open Source
in Research and Career Paths and Incentives.

## **Description of Proposed Project**

For Open Source in Research, we propose developmental work on the
[ArxLang project](https://github.com/arxlang/astx). This is because ArxLang
comprises several projects, the main ones being ASTx and IRx, which help
researchers start with generic components when working with compilers. In
general, ArxLang has the potential to change the way we approach data processing
and analysis and to foster collaboration and innovation within the community.

For Career Paths and Incentives, we propose support for internships as we
receive several requests from interested individuals every month. Internship
efforts include; brainstorming project ideas, assisting with activity planning,
supporting development or maintenance tasks, supporting official Open Science
Labs (OSL) communications, and providing relevant feedback or suggestions.

## **An Estimate of the Total Cost of the Project**

We estimate that this project will cost about $37,900. The breakdown is as
follows:

| Category                             | Individuals Involved | Unit Cost Per Month (USD) | Duration (Months) | Total Cost (USD) |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------- | :--------------- |
| Interns                              | 5                    | 1,000                     | 3                 | 15,000           |
| Development of ASTx and IRx projects | 2                    | 4,000                     | 2                 | 16,000           |

| Community Manager                    | 1                    | 300                       | 3                 | 900              |
|                                      |                      |                           |                   | **37,900**       |
