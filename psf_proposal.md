- Objective *:

  - What is the objective of your event/project?

    Improve a project template (for cookiecutter or cookieninja) that implements all (as much as possible) the best practices recommended by pyOpenSci, but not restricted to that, in order to offer all the current best practices approaches and tools as options, including CI, documentation, static analysis tools, etc. So anyone who wants to start a fresh project, would be able to start with a very good structure and workflow.

    Additionally, the grant would help us to maintain it for some months, in order to update the pinnings for the libraries and some configuration changes.

- Beneficiaries *:

    With this grant we plan to contract 2 people from our current group of
    collaborators. Yurely Camacho and Anavelyz Perez they are recent graduates
    in statistics, they live in Merida Venezuela, they are enthusiastic about
    open science and programming languages like Python.

- Regional Support
    The remain funding would be used to maintain the template updated and, if it is possible, add new features.

- Link to Code of Conduct *: https://opensciencelabs.org/guidelines/mentoring/en/coc/
