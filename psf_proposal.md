Objective *: 

- What is the objective of your event/project?

  Improve a project template (for cookiecutter or cookieninja) that implements all (as much as possible) the best practices recomended by pyOpenSci, but not restricted to that, in order to offer all the current best practices approaches and tools as options, including CI, documentation, static analysis tools, etc. So anyone who wants to start a fresh project, would be able to start with a very good structure and workflow.

Additionally, part of the grant would help us to maintain it for some months, in order to update the pinnings for the libraries and some configuration changes.


- Beneficiaries *: With this grant we plan to contract 2 people from our current
    group of collaborators. Yurely Camacho and Anavelyz Perez they are recent
    graduates in statistics, they live in Merida Venezuela, they are
    enthusiastic about open science and programming languages like Python.

In addition to that, we want to know how post event/project information will be shared with the community. This could be blog postings, post-event write-ups, web pages, project updates, where recordings will be posted, etc.
