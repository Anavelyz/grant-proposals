# Python Software Foundation (PSF) Grant report: SciCookie

In January 2024 the PSF approved a new grant for SciCookie, the proposal was
submitted at the end of December 2023 and will be implemented between February
and April 2024\*, during which time we have been carrying out the following
tasks:

- Improve the documentation: to make it clearer, more complete and more
  accessible to new users.
- Improve configuration aspects: to facilitate the installation and use of
  SciCookie.
- Incorporate and/or update libraries and other tools: to extend the
  functionalities.
- Improve file structure: to make the code more organized and easier to
  maintain.
- Apply for pyOpenSci peer review: to obtain quality certification of the
  tool.\*\*

Below are the responses to the event report submitted to PSF.

  organization (that can be used for marketing purposes), please enter it below.

  The PSF grant has fueled a remarkable transformation of the SciCookie tool,
  enabling enhancements to its configuration, making new user customizations,
  and maintaining the tool altogether.

  This positive impact extends beyond the tool itself to the community members,
  whose skills have been enhanced in a number of areas:

  - Project implementation and organization: The management experience gained
    from the SciCookie project has provided the community members with the
    necessary tools to manage different projects and organize them towards their
    completion in the easiest way possible.

  - Problem solving and investigation: The whole SciCookie development process
    involved a number of technical problems and therefore required systematic
    troubleshooting, which enhanced this attribute in the participants.

  - Efficient Alternative Seeking: The need to find creative solutions to
    technical hurdles has improved participants' ability to effectively explore
    and evaluate different alternatives.

  - Inquiry and Suggestion Facilitation: The collaborative nature of the project
    has fostered a culture of open communication, where participants feel
    comfortable raising questions, sharing ideas, and proposing solutions.

  - Diffusion of the Python Programming Language: By participating in the
    development of SciCookie, members of the community have been able to improve
    their knowledge about Python, which could potentially help them to spread
    this programming language within the scientific environment.

  Open Science Labs would like to thank the PSF for the grant we received. It
  has been a great support for the development of SciCookie and to contribute to
  the professional and technical growth of our community.

- Photos & Photographer Credit _Please link any photos you have of the event. If
  the photos are not online please send in email. If available, please share who
  should be credited for the photos._

- May the PSF share your photos in communications or marketing materials? (For
  example, on our social media, on our blog, in our Annual Impact Report, or in
  newsletters.)

  -[] Yes

  -[] No

  -[] Please contact us before using photos.

- Participants \_Talk about the participants.

  _Did anyone stand out?_

  Anavelyz and Yurely were in charge of resolving the issues. Ever Vino was in
  charge of coordinating the timing and checking any blockages during the
  execution of the project, he also helped the participants with some of their
  doubts. Ivan Ogasawara was the one responsible for reviewing and approving the
  issues, as well as the suggestions and the path of wisdom.

- Participant Feedback _Did the people that attend have anything to say_ Thanks
  to PSF for the grant we received, it has allowed us to acquire new knowledge
  and in turn contribute by learning, it has given us the impetus and
  encouragement to share our knowledge and improve every day.

- Retrospective _Discuss what worked out well and what you would change for the
  next time if there is anything planned._

  We're pleased to report an 80% success rate for the grant implementation. This
  grant served as a valuable second chance to address previously identified
  areas for improvement within SciCookie, resulting in significant progress.

  However, a roadblock emerged related to PyOpenSci's lack of peer review for
  tools. We're actively collaborating with them to explore the possibility of
  establishing a review standard for tools like SciCookie in the near future.

- General Feedback _Anything else you want to say that didn't fit in anywhere
  else?_

[*] This time was extended because the activities required study time from the
participants.

[**] This implementation process has not been fully completed due to the fact
that this is a tool and the peer review is oriented to packages or libraries.
