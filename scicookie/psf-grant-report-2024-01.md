# Python Software Foundation (PSF) Grant report: SciCookie

In January 2024 the PSF approved a new grant for SciCookie, the proposal was
submitted at the end of December 2023 and will be implemented between February
and April 2024\*, during which time we have been carrying out the following
tasks:

- Improve the documentation: to make it clearer, more complete and more
  accessible to new users.
- Improve configuration aspects: to facilitate the installation and use of
  SciCookie.
- Incorporate and/or update libraries and other tools: to extend the
  functionalities.
- Improve file structure: to make the code more organized and easier to
  maintain.
- Apply for pyOpenSci peer review: to obtain quality certification of the
  tool.\*\*
