# Python Software Foundation (PSF) Grant report: SciCookie

In January 2024, the PSF approved a new grant for SciCookie. The proposal was
submitted at the end of December 2023 and is scheduled for implementation
between February and April 2024\*. During this period, we have undertaken the
following tasks:

- Documentation Improvement: Enhancing clarity, completeness, and accessibility
  for new users.
- Configuration Enhancement: Simplifying SciCookie installation and usage.
- Library Integration and Updates: Expanding functionalities through new
  libraries and tools.
- File Structure Refinement: Organizing code for improved maintenance.
- pyOpenSci Peer Review Application: Pursuing quality certification for the
  tool.\*\*

Below are the responses to the event report submitted to PSF.

- If you would like to share a quote about what the PSF grant means to your
  organization (that can be used for marketing purposes), please enter it below.

  The PSF grant has catalyzed a significant transformation of the SciCookie
  tool, enabling improvements in configuration, user customization, and overall
  maintenance.

  This impact extends beyond the tool itself to community members, enhancing
  their skills in various areas:

  - Project Management: The SciCookie project has equipped community members
    with valuable experience in project implementation and organization.

  - Problem-Solving: Participants honed their skills in systematic
    troubleshooting throughout the development process.
  - Innovative Thinking: Finding creative solutions to technical challenges has
    fostered a culture of exploring alternatives effectively.
  - Collaborative Communication: The project's collaborative nature has promoted
    open communication, encouraging participants to ask questions, share ideas,
    and propose solutions.
  - Promotion of Python: Contributing to SciCookie has deepened community
    members' knowledge of Python, potentially promoting its use in scientific
    contexts.

  Open Science Labs expresses gratitude to the PSF for their grant, which has
  significantly supported the development of SciCookie and contributed to the
  professional and technical growth of our community.

- Photos & Photographer Credit _Please link any photos you have of the event. If
  the photos are not online please send in email. If available, please share who
  should be credited for the photos._

- May the PSF share your photos in communications or marketing materials? (For
  example, on our social media, on our blog, in our Annual Impact Report, or in
  newsletters.)

  -[] Yes

  -[] No

  -[] Please contact us before using photos.

- Participants \_Talk about the participants.

  _Did anyone stand out?_

  In general, Anavelyz and Yurely were in charge of resolving the issues. Ever
  Vino was in charge of coordinating the timing and checking any blockages
  during the execution of the project, he also helped the participants with some
  of their doubts. Ivan Ogasawara was the one responsible for reviewing and
  approving the issues, as well as the suggestions and the path of wisdom.

- Participant Feedback _Did the people that attend have anything to say_ Thanks
  to PSF for the grant we received, it has allowed us to acquire new knowledge
  and in turn contribute by learning, it has given us the impetus and
  encouragement to share our knowledge and improve every day.

- Retrospective _Discuss what worked out well and what you would change for the
  next time if there is anything planned._

  We are pleased to report an 80% success rate in implementing the grant. This
  opportunity has been invaluable in addressing identified areas for improvement
  within SciCookie, resulting in substantial progress.

  However, we encountered a challenge with the absence of a peer review process
  from PyOpenSci for tools like SciCookie. We are actively collaborating with
  them to explore establishing a review standard in the near future.

- General Feedback _Anything else you want to say that didn't fit in anywhere
  else?_

[*] This time was extended because the activities required study time from the
participants.

[**] This implementation process has not been fully completed due to the fact
that this is a tool and the peer review is oriented to packages or libraries.
